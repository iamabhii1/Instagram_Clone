A Fragment represents a reusable portion of your app's UI.
A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input events.
Fragments cannot live on their own--they must be hosted by an activity or another fragment.
The fragment’s view hierarchy becomes part of, or attaches to, the host’s view hierarchy.
Activities are an ideal place to put global elements around your app's user interface, such as a navigation drawer.
Conversely, fragments are better suited to define and manage the UI of a single screen or portion of a screen.
